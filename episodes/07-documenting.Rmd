:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Why is documentation important?
- How is documentation organized?
- How is documentationn created?
- What is a "vignette"?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Emphasize the importance of documenting as you go to maintain clarity and accuracy.
- Understand how documentation is spread across various parts of the package.
- Identify where different documentation elements reside within an R package.
- Automate the documentation process with `roxygen2`, with support from `devtools` and `usethis`. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

Users of an R package will need to understand the purpose of the package and how to use its various functions.
Providing clear description of the contents with suitable examples will make the package easier to use.
For example a "vignette" is a short step-by-step demonstration at least the core functions included in the package.

Human memory is not always reliable, thus creating and updating the documentaion "*as you go*" will help you in maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation as it will be an "immediate" record of what you are doing "now." 

## Documenting Functions

The functions used in this package were described in XXXXXXXXXXXXX ETC.

Our purpose here is to add information ***within*** the function iteself that can be used to automatically generate help documents, in particular when a user will type **`?function_name`** to request help.

To achieve this goal, we will use the package `roxygen2` to add a template within an existing function. Some of this pacakge function are available as an RStudio command with the menu cascade: **Code** > **Insert Roxygen Skeleton**.

If this menu is not available, you may need to install  `roxygen2` with the R console command: `install.packages("roxygen2")`

Let's first see the process with a simple example following those steps:

- create a new RScript file with RStudio menu cascade: **File** > **New File** > **R Script**
- Write a simple "Hello World" function. For example:

```
hello <- function() {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
```

- Click in the text to place the mouse cursor within the function code.
- Activate the menu cascade: **Code** > **Insert Roxygen Skeleton**
- The function will be expanded to add comments above the function using special tags. 
- All tags start with the  Special comments (**`#'`**)

```
#' Title
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
hello <- function() {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
```

The first item, Title, is self explanatory.  
The second line in blank and should be used to add a short description of the function.
Additional lines starting with the special comment can be added for longer descriptions.

The **`@`** tag is added to additional specific code words that may play a role in the function.
They provide "metadata" to be used for creating help directives.

Roxygen will add these after evaluating the function itself. Here are a few examples:

- Parameters (@param)
- Return value (@return)
- Export tag (@export)
- Example usage (@examples)


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Use  **Insert Roxygen Skeleton** to annotate an R function

*Hint*: when a function is typed **without** the parentheses R will print the function code on the console.
For example: `ls` 

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

**Insert Roxygen Skeleton** will add the following to the top of the `ls` text (trucated for brevity.)

```
#' Title
#'
#' @param name 
#' @param pos 
#' @param envir 
#' @param all.names 
#' @param pattern 
#' @param sorted 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
function (name, pos = -1L, envir = as.environment(pos), all.names = FALSE, 
          pattern, sorted = TRUE) 
TRUNCATED HERE
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 2: Modify the `hello` function above to add a title and a decription

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

Here is one possible way of implementing this:

```
#' Title: Say Hello
#'
#' This function prints 'Hello, world!'.
#' @return A greeting message.
#' @export
hello <- function() {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
```

If you did not add a text on the `@return` line it's OK as we have not yet detailed the significance of these code words.

Once the package completed, the command `?hello` would open the help file for the `hello()` function. 
This help file would display the documentation generated from the Roxygen2 comments, including the title, description, and details about the functionâ€™s return value.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Roxygen2 tags 

The code words beginning with `@` are called Roxygen2 tags or Roxygen2 directives. 
As we just have seen, these tags are used to provide metadata in R functions.
These tags make it easier to generate help files and other documentation automatically.
Here are the meaning of the two tags from our `hello()` function:

- The `@export` tag indicates that the `hello()` function should be made available to users of the package. 
It ensures that the function is accessible when the package is loaded, allowing users to call `hello()` directly.

- The `@return` tag describes what the function returns. In this case, it indicates that the `hello()` function returns a *greeting message*.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints  

    - Document creation is automated with `roxygen2` using `devtools` and `usethis`
    - Documentation is spread across various parts of the package: *e.g.* functions comments and vignettes.
    - *Document as you go* while creating the package: it is important to maintain clarity and accuracy.
    - Update the documentation when as the package is updated.
