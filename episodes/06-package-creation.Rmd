:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How do you create a package in R?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- identify how package are organized and store on a userâ€™s machine
- explain the differences between each of the
- describe the iterative steps in the package creation process
- use devtools::create_package() to intialize the package development environment
- convert scripts into a package that can be used by others

## Introduction

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.txt) for static files and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output. 
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/) for full documentation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: What is the correct order of these steps?   

Organize the steps involved in the creation of a package
* __ binary  
* __ source  
* __ bundle  
* __ in-memory  
* __ installed   

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

* __ source  
* __ bundle  
* __ binary  
* __ installed  
* __ in-memory

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can also include figures generated from R Markdown:

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart illusion of a pyramid", fig.cap = "Sun arise each and every morning"}
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```

Or you can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- packages exist on multiple locations/formats 
- some package formats predate other formats
- describe the iterative steps in the package creation process
- the devtools package facilitates the package creation process for R
- a package is a collection of scripts encapsulated in a very specific way
